# Challenge 4 - PyCitySchools

## Summarizes the Analysis
The module had me create a breakdown of 15 schools - seven were district schools, and eight were charter schools. We took a look at reading and math scores, budgets, grade levels, school size, and type of school and created an easy-to-read summary of various points. The summary included 39k students, $24 million in school budgets, an average math score of 78.9%, an average reading score of 81.8%, and with 65% of the students passing both math a reading. 

## Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from calculations
I found it very interesting the average reading and math grades stayed consistent from 9th to 10 grade. You could make a prediction that their grades after the 9th grade would be ~1.3% different from when they graduated from the 12th grade.

Charter schools outperformed District schools by a significant margin. Not only did Charter schools perform better, but they also did it by spending less money per-headcount than district schools.
